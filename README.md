# EE422C-Project2

A rudimentary version of the game Mastermind

To run:
```python
java Driver [1]
```
The second command line argument represents whether the game is in testing mode or not. In testing mode, you are shown the secret code and then you guess from there, and this may help to learn how to play the game or verify that this version is running correctly.

To see your previous guesses, enter "HISTORY" as a guess and the screen will print out the list.
